💡 Today I completed an **AWS VPC Peering Lab**!

I configured a **peering connection** between:
- **Lab VPC (10.0.0.0/16)**  
- **Shared VPC (10.5.0.0/16)**  

Here’s what I did step by step:
✅ Created and accepted the VPC peering connection.  
✅ Configured **route tables** to enable cross-VPC communication.  
✅ Updated **security groups** and **network ACLs** to allow traffic.  
✅ Verified connectivity using **CloudWatch Flow Logs**.  

🔑 Key Takeaways:
- VPC peering is **not transitive** → you must configure routes on both sides.  
- **Security Groups are stateful** while **NACLs are stateless**.  
- Flow Logs are a powerful tool for troubleshooting.  

This lab gave me **hands-on AWS networking experience** that’s directly relevant to real-world cloud architecture. 🌐

🚀 Excited to keep building more AWS projects and strengthening my cloud foundations!
